SiameseNet

This folder contains the model of our Siamese Network. 

To run this, you need torch 0.30. Simply run siamese_network.py. 

Siamese_Networks.ipynb contains the complete result, including accuracy, visualization of feature vectors and test results. We also tried K-mean algorithm, also included in this file.


siamese_fake_image_detection.ipynb contains the complete code implementation for the fake image detections. To run this, you need torch 0.40. Get the result simply by running each cell in ipybn.
